# ZeroPrompt

**The Universal API Key. Access 300+ AI models. Pay only for what you consume.**

> **"Hey, can I borrow your API key?"**

We've all been there. You want to test a premium model like Claude 3.5 or GPT-4, but you don't want to pay a $20/month subscription just to send a few prompts. You ask a developer friend to lend you their key, promising to pay them back for the credits you use.

**ZeroPrompt is that friend.**

We act as a universal gateway to **300+ top-tier AI models**. We hold the enterprise keys so you don't have to. You simply connect your wallet and pay us back for **exactly** what you consume—whether it's a fraction of a cent for a query or a few cents for an image.

**Built on Avalanche using React Native (Web & Mobile).**

## ⚡ Two Ways to Use

ZeroPrompt is flexible. Use it as your daily AI assistant or as a developer tool.

### 1. Chat Mode ("ChatGPT" as a Service)
*Best for: Daily use, research, and coding assistance.*

Stop paying monthly fees for subscriptions you don't use 24/7.
- **How it works:** You **pre-fund** your account (Vault) with **AVAX**.
- **The Experience:** Connect your wallet, deposit $5 worth of AVAX, and start chatting.
- **The Benefit:** The cost of each message is deducted from your balance in real-time. Switch from GPT-4 to Mistral to Flux Pro in the same chat window instantly.

### 2. Developer Mode (The x402 Protocol)
*Best for: Scripts, Apps, and AI Agents.*

This is the "atomic" way to pay. No deposits required—just pay per request.
- **How it works:** Your code sends a request, receives a price quote (HTTP 402), and signs a payment authorization instantly.
- **Payment Options:**
  - **USDC:** Gasless payments via EIP-3009 (Server sponsors the gas).
  - **AVAX:** Standard direct payments.
- **The Flow:** `Request → 402 Error (Price) → Sign & Pay → Get Response`.

## 🔍 Finding the Right Model (AI Reputation)

With access to **300+ models**, the hardest part is knowing which one to use.

ZeroPrompt solves this with a **Decentralized Reputation System (ERC-8004)**.
Instead of biased leaderboards, we use on-chain ratings. If you need a model for "Python Coding" or "Creative Writing," you can filter by community trust. Because ratings are on Avalanche, they are transparent and cannot be faked by providers.

## 📱 Mobile Native

ZeroPrompt isn't just a website. We built the entire architecture using **React Native (Expo)**, ensuring a seamless experience across Desktop, iOS, and Android.
- **Unified Wallet:** Connect via WalletConnect once, use everywhere.
- **Performance:** Native speed for chat interfaces and image rendering.
